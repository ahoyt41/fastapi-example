# FastAPI Example

This project is an example of a FastAPI application used to present
FastAPI and pydantic for [Rocky Python](https://rockypython.org). It
is a basic score board application.

## Setup

The project uses poetry for dependency managment and poethepoet for running tasks.

### Install Poetry

```bash
# with the official installer
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3

#globally with pip
pip install poetry

# or with pipx
pipx install poetry
```

### Install poethepoet

```bash
# systemwide with pip
pip install poethepoet

# or per user with pipx 
pipx install poethepoet
```

### Install Depedencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### Install Client Depedencies

The project also includes a client implementation using `httpx`.
To install client dependencies run

```bash
poetry install -E client
```

### Setting up the "database"

This project uses a json file as mock database named `fastapi_example.db.json`
If this file is missing, it can be generated by running `poetry run python scripts/create_data.py`

## Running the server

To run the server you can either use the predefined poe task

```
poe run
```

Or start it up manually

```
poetry run uvicorn fastapi_example:app
```


## Running the Demo

The demo script `scripts/demo.py` shows an example of how to interface with
the API as well as some of its data validation capabilites. The script can be
run with poe via

```bash
poe demo
```
